## üì¶ Step 1: Build Production Extension

### Quick Build (Automated)

```bash
# Build for production with the correct backend URL
pnpm build

# Create ZIP package for Chrome Web Store
pnpm zip
```

### Manual Build (if needed)

```bash
# Clean previous builds
pnpm clean:bundle

# Set environment variable
export NODE_ENV=production

# Build
pnpm build

# Create ZIP
pnpm zip
```

**Output locations:**
- Built extension: `./dist/`
- ZIP package: `./dist-zip/NoGoon-0.4.3-chrome.zip`

---

## üß™ Step 2: Test Extension Locally

Before submitting, test the production build:

1. **Load the extension:**
   ```
   chrome://extensions/
   ```

2. **Enable "Developer mode"** (toggle in top right)

3. **Click "Load unpacked"**

4. **Select the `dist` folder**

5. **Copy the Extension ID** (looks like: `kjmbccjnkgcpboiiomckhdogdhociajd`)
   - Save this! You'll need it for CORS configuration

6. **Test all features:**
   - ‚úÖ Click extension icon
   - ‚úÖ Sign in with Privy
   - ‚úÖ Create/view wallets (Ethereum & Solana)
   - ‚úÖ Block NSFW content on test sites
   - ‚úÖ View statistics (if backend is working)
   - ‚úÖ Check browser console for errors

---

## üîê Step 3: Update Backend CORS (IMPORTANT!)

Once you have your Extension ID from testing, update Railway:

### Option A: Railway Dashboard
1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Open your backend service
3. Go to **Variables** tab
4. Update `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`:
   ```
   ["chrome-extension://YOUR_ACTUAL_EXTENSION_ID"]
   ```
5. Save (will trigger redeploy)

### Option B: Railway CLI
```bash
railway variables set ALLOWED_ORIGINS='["chrome-extension://YOUR_EXTENSION_ID"]'
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL:** The Extension ID will change when you publish to the Chrome Web Store! You'll need to update CORS again after publishing with the production Extension ID.
