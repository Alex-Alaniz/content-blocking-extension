You MUST create screenshots before submitting. Here's how:

```bash

#    - Content blocking in action
#    - Settings/features
```

### Step 2: Create Privacy Policy (10 min)

**Option A: Use the Template (Fastest)**
- File: `PRIVACY_POLICY.md`
- Host it on GitHub Pages or your website
- Get the URL

**Option B: Create Your Own**
- Must cover: data collection, usage, sharing, user rights
- Must be publicly accessible

### Step 3: Submit to Chrome Web Store (10-15 min)

**Go to**: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/devconsole

**Upload**: `dist-zip/extension-20251003-030923.zip`

**Fill in**: Copy content from `SUBMIT_TO_CHROME_STORE.md`

**Submit**: For review

### Step 4: Wait for Approval (1-3 business days)

You'll receive an email from Google Chrome Web Store team.

### Step 5: Update Backend CORS (CRITICAL!)
