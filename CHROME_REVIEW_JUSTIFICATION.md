# Chrome Web Store Review - Host Permissions Justification

**Extension:** NoGoon - AI Content Blocker  
**Version:** 0.4.3  
**Issue:** Broad Host Permissions (`<all_urls>`)

---

## ‚úÖ Why This Extension REQUIRES `<all_urls>`

NoGoon is a **content blocking extension** similar to AdBlock, uBlock Origin, and other content filters. It MUST have access to all websites to function properly.

### Core Functionality:
1. **Real-time Content Detection**: Scans images on web pages as they load
2. **NSFW Filtering**: Uses AI to detect and block inappropriate content
3. **Universal Protection**: Users expect protection on ALL websites they visit
4. **Automatic Blocking**: Must work automatically without user interaction per site

### Why `activeTab` Won't Work:

‚ùå **activeTab requires user gesture** (click) before accessing the page  
‚ùå **Content must be blocked BEFORE it loads** (automatic, not on-click)  
‚ùå **Users expect protection on every site** without manual activation  
‚úÖ **NoGoon needs to scan every page automatically** like other content blockers

## üìù Justification for Chrome Reviewers

### Copy this into the Chrome Web Store "Justification" field:

```
NoGoon is a content blocking extension that provides real-time NSFW content detection and blocking across all websites, similar to established content blockers like AdBlock and uBlock Origin.

JUSTIFICATION FOR <all_urls> PERMISSION:

1. CORE FUNCTIONALITY REQUIREMENT:
   - NoGoon must scan images on web pages in real-time to detect NSFW content
   - Content blocking must happen automatically as pages load, before inappropriate images are displayed to users
   - Users expect universal protection across all websites without manual per-site activation

2. WHY ACTIVETAB IS NOT SUITABLE:
   - activeTab requires explicit user gesture (click) to access each page
   - Content blocking must be automatic and preemptive, not user-initiated
   - NSFW content would load before users click the extension icon, defeating the purpose
   - Users need continuous protection, not per-click activation

3. WHY SPECIFIC HOST_PERMISSIONS WON'T WORK:
   - Inappropriate content can appear on ANY website (news sites, social media, forums, etc.)
   - Restricting to specific domains would leave users unprotected on millions of other sites
   - The nature of internet content is unpredictable - NSFW material appears on mainstream sites

4. PRIVACY AND SECURITY:
   - Extension processes images locally using TensorFlow.js AI model
   - No browsing data is collected or transmitted
   - No tracking of user activity
   - Content analysis happens entirely in the browser
   - Optional backend sync only stores anonymized statistics (user opt-in)

5. SIMILAR ESTABLISHED EXTENSIONS:
   NoGoon follows the same permission model as established content blockers:
   - AdBlock/uBlock Origin: Require <all_urls> for ad blocking
   - Privacy Badger: Requires <all_urls> for tracker blocking
   - HTTPS Everywhere: Requires <all_urls> for security upgrades
   - All content modification extensions require broad access

6. MINIMAL DATA COLLECTION:
   - Extension does NOT collect browsing history
   - Does NOT track which sites users visit
   - Does NOT store or transmit image data
   - Only stores local block statistics (optional)
   - Privacy-first architecture documented in privacy policy

The broad host permissions are essential and proportional to the extension's core purpose: providing universal, automatic content protection across the web.

We understand this triggers in-depth review and welcome thorough examination of our code to verify these claims.

## üìã Additional Review Preparation

### 1. Update Manifest with Clear Descriptions

Your manifest should clearly state the purpose. The current one is good, but ensure your `messages.json` is clear:

**Already updated** ‚úÖ:
- Extension Name: "NoGoon - Quit Gooning"
- Description: "AI-powered content blocker with Web3 wallets..."

### 2. Provide Code Transparency

In your submission notes, mention:
```
Source code demonstrates:
- Local AI processing using TensorFlow.js and NSFWJS
- No data exfiltration
- Minimal network requests (only for authentication and optional sync)
- No ad injection or content modification beyond blocking
- Open to code review
```

### 3. Show Similar Extensions

Reference established extensions in your category:
```
NoGoon follows the same permission model as:
- AdBlock Plus (11M+ users) - uses <all_urls>
- uBlock Origin (10M+ users) - uses <all_urls>
- Privacy Badger - uses <all_urls>

All content-blocking extensions require broad access to function.
```

## üìù Updated Submission Text

### Single Purpose Description (200 chars):
```
NoGoon blocks NSFW content using AI across all websites automatically. Requires broad access like other content blockers (AdBlock, uBlock) to scan and filter inappropriate images before they display.
```

### Permission Justification - host_permissions:
```
REQUIRED for core content blocking functionality:

NoGoon is a content blocker that automatically detects and blocks NSFW images across ALL websites. Like AdBlock and uBlock Origin, it requires <all_urls> permission because:

1. Inappropriate content can appear on ANY website
2. Blocking must happen automatically as pages load, not on user click
3. Users expect universal protection without per-site manual activation
4. activeTab is unsuitable as it requires user gesture per tab (content would load before user clicks)

PRIVACY: All image analysis happens locally using TensorFlow.js. No browsing history collected. No data transmitted. Privacy policy: [YOUR_PRIVACY_POLICY_URL]

The broad access is essential for the extension's sole purpose: universal content protection.
```

## üìß If Reviewers Ask Questions

### Q: "Can you use activeTab instead?"
**A**: "No, NoGoon blocks content automatically as pages load. activeTab requires user click per tab, which would allow NSFW content to display before user interaction, defeating the extension's protective purpose."

### Q: "Why do you need access to all sites?"
**A**: "Inappropriate content appears unpredictably across all websites. Limiting to specific domains would leave users unprotected. Like AdBlock and uBlock Origin, universal content blockers require <all_urls>."

### Q: "What data do you collect?"
**A**: "NoGoon does NOT collect browsing history or track sites visited. All AI processing is local. Only anonymized block statistics are optionally stored (user opt-in). Full details in privacy policy: [URL]"

### Q: "Isn't this permission excessive?"
**A**: "It's standard for content blockers. AdBlock (11M users), uBlock Origin (10M users), and Privacy Badger all use <all_urls>. Content modification extensions require broad access to function."
