# Railway Service Sync Guide

## üöÄ Quick Setup

Since both your PostgreSQL service and backend are in the same Railway project, here's how to sync them:

### 1. Link to Your Project

```bash
cd backend
railway link
# Select your project from the list
# Choose environment (usually 'production')
```

### 2. Verify Services Are Connected

```bash
# Check project status
railway status

# List all services in the project
railway list

# Check environment variables
railway variables
```

### 3. Sync Database

```bash
# Test database connection
railway run psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT 1;"

# Initialize database tables
railway run python init_railway_db.py

# Or use the interactive database script
railway run python init_db.py init
```

### 4. Deploy Backend

```bash
# Deploy the backend service
railway up

# Check deployment status
railway logs
```

### 5. Verify Everything Works

```bash
# Get service URL
railway domain

# Test health endpoint
curl https://your-service-url.railway.app/health
```

## üîß Manual Commands

### Database Operations

```bash
# Connect to database
railway run psql $DATABASE_URL

# Run database initialization
railway run python init_railway_db.py

# Check database tables
railway run psql $DATABASE_URL -c "\dt"
```

### Backend Operations

```bash
# Deploy backend
railway up

# View logs
railway logs

# Check service status
railway status
```

### Environment Variables

```bash
# View all variables
railway variables

# Set a variable
railway variables --set "KEY=value"

# View variables for specific service
railway variables --service backend
```

## üè• Health Check

After syncing, test these endpoints:

1. **Health Check**: `https://your-service-url.railway.app/health`
   - Should show `"database": "connected"`
   - Should show table count and connection details

2. **API Test**: `https://your-service-url.railway.app/api/v1/auth/login`
   - Should return proper error (not 500)

3. **Stats API**: `https://your-service-url.railway.app/api/v1/users/stats`
   - Should work with proper authentication

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Issues

```bash
# Check if database URL is correct
railway variables | grep DATABASE_URL

# Test connection manually
railway run psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT version();"

# Check if tables exist
railway run psql $DATABASE_URL -c "\dt"
```

### Backend Issues

```bash
# Check logs for errors
railway logs --tail 50

# Restart service
railway up --detach

# Check service status
railway status
```

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Make sure all required variables are set
railway variables | grep -E "(DATABASE_URL|PRIVY_APP_ID|SECRET_KEY)"

# Set missing variables
railway variables --set "PRIVY_APP_ID=cmg74h4sm0035le0c1k99b1gz"
railway variables --set "SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key"
```

## üìã Required Environment Variables

Make sure these are set in your Railway project:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:password@host:port/database
PRIVY_APP_ID=cmg74h4sm0035le0c1k99b1gz
PRIVY_APP_SECRET=your-privy-secret
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
ENVIRONMENT=production
```

## üéØ Expected Results

After successful sync:

1. ‚úÖ Database connection established
2. ‚úÖ All tables created
3. ‚úÖ Backend deployed and running
4. ‚úÖ Health check shows "connected"
5. ‚úÖ API endpoints working
6. ‚úÖ Chrome extension can authenticate

## üÜò Need Help?

If you're still having issues:

1. Run the interactive sync script: `./railway_sync.sh`
2. Check Railway dashboard for service status
3. Review logs: `railway logs`
4. Test database connection manually
5. Verify environment variables are set correctly
