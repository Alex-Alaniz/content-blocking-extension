## 🎬 Deploy Backend to Railway (Start Here!)

### Option A: Railway Dashboard (Recommended for first time)

1. **Go to Railway**: https://railway.app
2. **Sign in with GitHub**
3. **Create New Project** → Add PostgreSQL database
4. **Add Backend Service**:
   - Click "+ New"
   - Select "GitHub Repo"
   - Choose: `Alex-Alaniz/content-blocking-extension`
   - Set Root Directory: `backend`
5. **Set Environment Variables** (copy from checklist):
   ```bash
   # See: backend/RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md
   # Or use the checklist interactively
   ```
6. **Generate Domain** and copy URL
7. **Initialize Database**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://YOUR-RAILWAY-URL.railway.app/api/v1/admin/init-database
   ```

**Detailed Checklist:** See `backend/RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md`

### Option B: Railway CLI (Faster if you know CLI)

```bash
# Install CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Deploy
cd backend
railway login
railway init
railway add  # Choose PostgreSQL

# Set variables and deploy
# See DEPLOY_NOW.md for full command list

railway up
railway domain  # Copy this URL!
```

## 📦 Build Chrome Extension

Once backend is deployed, build the extension:

### Automated Build (Recommended)

```bash
# Run the deployment script
./deploy-production.sh
```

When prompted:
- Enter your Railway backend URL
- Script will build and create ZIP package

### Manual Build

```bash
# Create production environment file
cat > .env.production << EOF
VITE_PRIVY_APP_ID=cmg74h4sm0035le0c1k99b1gz
VITE_BACKEND_URL=https://YOUR-RAILWAY-URL.railway.app
NODE_ENV=production
EOF

# Build
pnpm clean:bundle && pnpm build && pnpm zip
```

**Output:**
- Built extension: `./dist/`
- ZIP package: `./dist-zip/NoGoon-0.4.3-chrome.zip`
