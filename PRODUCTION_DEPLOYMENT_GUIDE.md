# ðŸš€ Production Deployment Guide - NoGoon Extension

**Last Updated:** October 3, 2025  
**Status:** Ready for Production Deployment

## âš¡ Quick Deployment Overview

This guide covers deploying:
1. **Backend API** to Railway (FastAPI + PostgreSQL)
2. **Chrome Extension** to Chrome Web Store

---

## Part 1: Backend Deployment to Railway

### Prerequisites
- Railway account (https://railway.app)
- GitHub repository connected
- PostgreSQL service already provisioned (appears to be done)

### Option A: Deploy via Railway Dashboard (Recommended)

#### Step 1: Access Your Railway Project

Go to your Railway dashboard and access your project (if you already have one).

#### Step 2: Create Backend Service

1. Click **"+ New"** in your Railway project
2. Select **"GitHub Repo"**
3. Choose repository: `Alex-Alaniz/content-blocking-extension`
4. Configure the service:
   - **Service Name**: `backend-api`
   - **Root Directory**: `backend`
   - **Watch Paths**: `backend/**`

#### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

In the Railway dashboard, add these environment variables to your backend service:

```bash
# Core Settings
ENVIRONMENT=production
PORT=8000

# Privy Authentication (KEEP THESE SECURE!)
PRIVY_APP_ID=cmg74h4sm0035le0c1k99b1gz
PRIVY_APP_SECRET=4iU5owbvwJ4TdhUCQhE63iguj261qWwh6AK1QJEJ6K8qs49TWCaeWJYzEtifD4W7JoxAQac9ADkPwBwz2yu43J8p
PRIVY_VERIFICATION_KEY=auto_fetched_from_privy_api

# Security - GENERATE A NEW SECRET KEY!
SECRET_KEY=<RUN: openssl rand -hex 32>

# CORS - Update after getting Chrome Extension ID
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=["chrome-extension://YOUR_EXTENSION_ID_HERE"]
ALLOWED_HOSTS=["*"]

# Subscription Pricing
SUBSCRIPTION_PRICE_USD=20.0
TOKEN_PAYMENT_DISCOUNT=0.5
FREE_BLOCKS_PER_DAY=10

# Rate Limiting
RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE=60

# Optional Web3 RPC URLs
ETHEREUM_RPC_URL=
SOLANA_RPC_URL=https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com
```

**IMPORTANT:** Generate a secure SECRET_KEY:
```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```

#### Step 4: Link PostgreSQL Database

1. In the backend service settings â†’ **Variables** tab
2. Click **"Add Variable Reference"**
3. Select your PostgreSQL service
4. Add references to:
   - `DATABASE_URL`
   - `DATABASE_PUBLIC_URL`

Railway will automatically inject these from your Postgres service.

#### Step 5: Deploy

1. Railway should automatically deploy when you save the configuration
2. Wait for deployment to complete (check the **Deployments** tab)
3. Once deployed, note your backend URL (e.g., `https://backend-api-production.up.railway.app`)

#### Step 6: Generate Domain (if needed)

1. Go to **Settings** tab
2. Click **"Generate Domain"**
3. Copy the generated URL (you'll need this for the extension)

#### Step 7: Initialize Database

Once deployed, initialize the database tables:

```bash
# Get your backend URL from Railway
BACKEND_URL="https://your-backend-url.railway.app"

# Initialize database
curl -X POST "$BACKEND_URL/api/v1/admin/init-database"

# Verify tables were created
curl "$BACKEND_URL/api/v1/admin/check-tables"

# Test health endpoint
curl "$BACKEND_URL/health"
```

Expected response from `/health`:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "environment": "production",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "database": "configured"
}
```

### Option B: Deploy via Railway CLI

```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login
railway login

# Link to project (if you have an existing one)
railway link

# Deploy from backend directory
cd backend
railway up

# Set environment variables
railway variables set ENVIRONMENT=production
railway variables set PRIVY_APP_ID=cmg74h4sm0035le0c1k99b1gz
railway variables set SECRET_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
# ... (add all other variables)

# Get your deployment URL
railway domain
```

---

## Part 2: Chrome Extension Build & Deployment

### Step 1: Get Your Backend Production URL

After deploying to Railway, you should have a URL like:
```
https://backend-api-production.up.railway.app
```

### Step 2: Create Production Environment File

Create `.env.production` in the project root:

```bash
# Privy Configuration
VITE_PRIVY_APP_ID=cmg74h4sm0035le0c1k99b1gz

# Backend API URL (Your Railway URL)
VITE_BACKEND_URL=https://YOUR-RAILWAY-URL.railway.app

# Environment
NODE_ENV=production
```

### Step 3: Build the Extension for Production

```bash
# From project root
cd /Users/alexalaniz/Documents/GitHub/content-blocking-extension

# Clean previous builds
pnpm clean:bundle

# Set production environment and build
export VITE_BACKEND_URL=https://YOUR-RAILWAY-URL.railway.app
export VITE_PRIVY_APP_ID=cmg74h4sm0035le0c1k99b1gz

# Build for Chrome
pnpm build

# Create ZIP package for Chrome Web Store
pnpm zip
```

This creates:
- Built extension in `dist/` directory
- ZIP package in `dist-zip/` directory (ready for Chrome Web Store)

### Step 4: Get Your Extension ID

1. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable **Developer Mode** (toggle in top right)
3. Click **Load unpacked**
4. Select the `dist/` folder
5. **Copy the Extension ID** (format: `kjmbccjnkgcpboiiomckhdogdhociajd`)

### Step 5: Update Backend CORS Settings

Update the Railway environment variable `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` with your Extension ID:

```bash
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=["chrome-extension://YOUR_ACTUAL_EXTENSION_ID"]
```

In Railway dashboard:
1. Go to backend service â†’ **Variables**
2. Update `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` variable
3. Save (this will trigger a redeployment)

### Step 6: Rebuild Extension with Correct Backend URL

Now that you have the final backend URL, rebuild the extension:

```bash
# Update .env.production with final Railway URL
echo "VITE_BACKEND_URL=https://YOUR-RAILWAY-URL.railway.app" >> .env.production

# Rebuild
pnpm clean:bundle && pnpm build && pnpm zip
```

### Step 7: Test the Extension Locally

1. Load the unpacked extension from `dist/` in Chrome
2. Open the extension popup
3. Test authentication with Privy
4. Check browser console for any errors
5. Verify backend communication:
   - Open DevTools â†’ Network tab
   - Filter by your Railway URL
   - Sign in and verify API calls succeed
